title: Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2018 with Zulip
---
Great news!<br>
I have been selected for [GSoC 2018](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6321219691872256).

I’ll be working with [Zulip](github.com/zulip/) and I will focus on the desktop client of Zulip to address some of the high priority issues and make Zulip desktop app at par with the other major desktop apps. I’ll be mentored by [Akash Nimare](https://github.com/akashnimare). 

### Working with Zulip

My journey with Zulip has be excellent so far. Zulip’s well-maintained multi-platform (Web, Desktop, Mobile) support and codebase as an open source organization really impressed me. I love how different tests and linters were implemented across all projects and the usage of zulipbot for claiming issues and labelling intrigued me more
towards the organization workflow. Through my contributions in Zulip I have learnt a lot about open source development and more importantly about good software development techniques and working in teams.<br>
I am excited about contributing to Zulip and hope to meet the expected standards.


### Project Abstract

The major aim would be to solve most of the high priority open issues from issues, polishing up parts of the UI,
refactoring code, improving the current test suite and setup a proper error logging system. I also hope to focus on
some of the new required features and contribute to fixing some of the issues that users report during this period.

### Blog and Checkins

I have still to figure out how often would I post on this blog. I am planning something of a bi-weekly update posts but that'd depend on how the work progresses and my feeling to jot down some those stuff. <br>
On the [developer channel](https://chat.zulip.org/), I plan to have a weekly checkins on the [checkins stream](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/65-checkins) documenting the progress I have made and the targets achieved.
