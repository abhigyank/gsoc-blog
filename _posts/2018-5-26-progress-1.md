This phase saw release of v2.3.1 of the desktop client, which had a few of thee features added and it feels great to have my code running on so many computers.

### Validation of custom certificates 
Major time was spent on working on this high priority issue [#126](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-electron/issues/126). I was trying to do fixups on #383, which was an attempt for a fix to this, but then I realised this was totally a wrong approach. I came with a working approach after some discussion on czo, which works brilliantly by leveeraging request modules ability to verify custom certificates from website and local. I created a PR [#494](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-electron/pull/494) which lays down the basic implementation. I hope to make a couple small changes to it this week.


### Add an option to check for updates
Important feature at #D493 - which should really help people force check for updates when the autoUpdator fails. It'd also help us debug errors due which update may have failed.


### Security fixes
A important security fix to prevent XSS attacks were added in [dbe89c](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-electron/commit/dbe89cdd093aaefe97b76035dc01a5ef59f0788c) and [d69c13](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-electron/commit/d69c1339e6efe5c8a1c8a7c6400fb373e1b6b468), I spent quite sometime with Akash to fix the security issue before the release.

Other than this, we also had a change in the stream name of desktop client moving from #electron to #desktop. For which I had two commits in the main Zulip repo in [#9535](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/9535) and one in the electron repo at [#499](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-electron/pull/499) making the necessary changes in the documentation.<br>

Since the start of this week I have been spending quite reduced amount of time working in liew of preparing for my end semester exams. I'll take break, being completely offline from next week, when my exams start. I would be again picking up at full gear from the second week of June when my exams end.

See ya!
